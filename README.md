"Image Filter App: Python GUI with Tkinter &amp; OpenCV. Apply grayscale, invert, blur, sketch, watercolor &amp; pencil sketch filters. Easy image loading &amp; capture. Ideal for beginners &amp; enthusiasts. Enhance photos creatively! ðŸŽ¨ #Python #OpenCV #Tkinter"

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for loading, capturing, and applying various filters to images. Built using Tkinter for the GUI and OpenCV for image processing, the application allows users to:
- Load images from their device or choose from predefined options.
- Capture images using the webcam.
- Apply filters such as grayscale, invert, blur, sketch, watercolor, and pencil sketch.
- View the filtered images in real-time on the canvas.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly demonstration of integrating Tkinter and OpenCV libraries to create an interactive image manipulation tool.

Features:
- Simple and intuitive GUI layout.
- Option to load images from different sources.
- Real-time preview of applied filters.
- Easy-to-use buttons for filter selection and image manipulation.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pillow (PIL)

Usage:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies (mentioned in code).
- Change the image path to your required path.
- Run the image_filter.py script.
- Select an image source and apply filters as desired.
